# order_online

This is the customer facing web app for online ordering. Currently a work in progress.

The point of this web app is to easily integrate online ordering for any restaurant with minimal setup involved. It will allow customers to add items from the menu (dynamically loaded based on restaurant & location) into their cart, and pay for said items via Stripe. When customers order, the app will remember their details for next time if they make an account. We will also facilitate the ability to send texts through the app from the kitchen to the customer on the status of their order.

The second part of this business will be a business facing mobile application that allows the business to update settings, their menu, and more.
